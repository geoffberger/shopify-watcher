#Spotify Watcher

This simple and pretty trivial node module that works in conjunction with https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme.

##Installation

Go into your working shopify theme directory and run the following to install:

    npm install git://github.com/geoffberger/shopify-watcher.git

##Usage

Once you have gone through the setup setup steps in the shopify_theme project,
create a file say `listen.js` with the following contents:

    require('shopify_watcher')('/full/path/to/shopify/theme/directory')

So if you are working from this path:

    /Users/@username@/Workspace/shopify_themes/foo_theme

This is what you would pass into the node script. Once the file has been
created run, the node script:

    node listen.js

Open up a new tab to your shopify theme, and start modifying. You'll see the
logging occur from the node script. Refresh the browser and you should be good
to go.
